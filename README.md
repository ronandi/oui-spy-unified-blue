## What it is

OUI-SPY APEX is a fork of the OUI-SPY unified firmware, rebuilt around two ideas: **run every detector simultaneously**, and **control it all from your phone instead of a captive portal**.

---

## Quick Start

1. **Flash the board** — open the [web flasher](https://lukeswitz.github.io/oui-spy-unified-blue/) in Chrome or Edge, plug in via USB-C, hit **Connect & Flash**. One time only.
2. **Install the app** — [Android APK](https://github.com/lukeswitz/oui-spy-unified-blue/releases/latest) · [iOS / macOS TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/5RCKgnJ2) · [macOS signed build](https://github.com/lukeswitz/oui-spy-unified-blue/releases/latest).
3. **Connect** — open the app, tap **CONNECT**, pick your board from the **SCAN FOR OUI-SPY** list.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some versions of Android will not prompt for location permissions. Location > Allow Always is required for the app to scan in background when app is not on screen/device locked.

- APEX doesn't auto-connect unless you opt in (*Settings → App → Connection*). On launch it drops stale links and waits for you to choose a device.

## The Eight Engines

Toggle any combination from the home screen — they all run together

| Engine | Radio | What it finds | Plain-English purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Detector** | WiFi + BLE | Anything on your watchlist | Your own targets — a MAC, a vendor prefix, a device name, or a BLE service UUID |
| **Flock BLE** | BLE | Flock cameras, Raven gunshot sensors | Spot Flock surveillance gear by its Bluetooth fingerprint |
| **Flock WiFi** | WiFi | Flock Safety cameras | Spot the same cameras by their WiFi traffic |
| **Foxhunter** | WiFi + BLE | One chosen target, by signal strength | Walk toward a device — the buzzer speeds up as you close in |
| **Sky Spy** | WiFi + BLE | FAA Remote ID drones | See drones broadcasting Remote ID and where their operator is |
| **UniPwn** | BLE | Unitree robots | Detect, connect to, and exploit Unitree robots |
| **Wardrive** | WiFi + BLE | Every AP and BLE device | Classic WiGLE-style logging — SSID, BSSID, channel, auth, GPS |
| **PCAP** | WiFi *or* BLE | Raw frames | Capture 802.11 or BLE link-layer packets straight to your phone |

Detailed mechanics for each are in [Detection Internals](#detection-internals).

## The App

Cross-Platform Flutter app for iOS, macOS, and Android

<img width="610" alt="APEX overview" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a798936-51f3-41d2-b103-cdec0e7d9134" />


### Home
One card per engine. Tap a card to toggle the engine or open its settings. The status bar shows connection state, GPS fix, and node count.

### Live Feed
Every detection from every engine, in one stream.
- **Filter** by engine, by preset (e.g. surveillance-only), or by which node found it.
- **Sort** by time, RSSI, or MAC; free-text search across the list.
- **Export** the current filtered view to WiGLE CSV.
- **Tap** a row to foxhunt or map that device; **long-press** for the full detail sheet (MAC, vendor, RSSI, channel, manufacturer data).

### Wardrive Map
The headline feature.


<img width="709" alt="App home" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62470061-c382-4724-8d86-72cb4dd4c1df" />
Pick any mix of targets — **WiGLE, Flock, Drone, Detector** — plus a radio (**WiFi, BLE, or Both**), then hit **START**. The chosen engines run together and plot hits live, color-graded by signal density, with your route trailing behind you.

- **Drones** plot at their broadcast Remote ID position. When a drone reports no fix (0/0), it draws an RSSI range ring around you instead. Drone and pilot trails are tracked separately.
- **Stacked pins** (overlapping Flock / drone / detector hits) fan out on leader lines so each stays readable.
- The top bar tallies hits per engine in real time.
- **Geofences** — draw an excluded zone and everything inside it goes silent: no feed entry, no logging, no CSV, no beep, and the radios pause entirely. Scanning resumes the moment you leave the zone.
- Sessions save as WiGLE CSV and upload directly to WiGLE with your API key. Saved sessions replay on the map.

<img width="910" alt="Wardrive map" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc0d4cc9-6524-41c7-bb04-9cd01dae58b8" />

### PCAP
Packet capture with no SD card — frames stream over BLE and the app writes a `.pcap` you open in Wireshark.

<img width="910" alt="PCAP" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b34e73d-1341-4222-8ec2-d17a179f6faa" />

- **WiFi 802.11 (radiotap)** — beacons, probes, deauth, data, control, and management frames across a channel range.
- **BLE LL** — adverts and scan request/response with synthesized link-layer headers.
- **Auto-PCAP** — when a detection engine fires, the board automatically captures for 3–120 s (with a cooldown and a per-MAC rediscover window), then goes back to scanning. Each capture is auto-labeled with the engine and MAC that triggered it.

### Over-the-Air Updates
*Settings → Updates → Check for Update.* Update over **WiFi** (fast — give credentials once) or **BLE** (works anywhere, slower). No cables after the first flash. In node mode, each live node updates the same way, one at a time.

### Settings
Everything else: appearance, units, scan timing, channel range, the 39k+ OUI vendor database (with WiGLE CSV import), WiGLE login, buzzer/LED, firmware timing, station-mode WiFi, factory reset, watchlist, ignore list, and database import/export for backing up and restoring captures.

<img width="1133" alt="Settings" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8072937-67fb-4ae3-adc0-d1c748a26983" />

### iOS Dynamic Island
On iPhone 14 Pro and newer (iOS 16.2+), live detection counts show on the Lock Screen and Dynamic Island during a session.

---

## Node Mode (run a swarm)

Flash one board as a **manager** (`mgr-xiao_s3` recommended — its PSRAM keeps a deep detection buffer; the C3's ~6 KB free heap bottlenecks a busy swarm) and the rest as **nodes** (`node-xiao_s3`). Power them on — nodes auto-join in ~10 s with no pairing. Connect the app to the manager.

- Detection engines run across **all** nodes at once; every hit is tagged with the node that found it.
- The manager splits the WiFi channel range across nodes, so more boards cover the band faster and cover more ground.
- On a WiGLE wardrive **START**, a popup lets you set each node to **WiFi / BLE / Both**.
- **PCAP** captures from a single node you select.

Manager settings (buzzer, LED, alert timing, ignore list, wardrive radio) push to every node and **override** their local copies — one place drives the whole swarm. Turning an engine off or closing the app stops the nodes; nothing scans unattended.

---

## Detection Internals

802.11 frames carry three MAC fields: **addr1** (receiver), **addr2** (transmitter), **addr3** (BSSID). Several engines check all three so a target is caught regardless of which role it plays in a frame.

### Flock — cameras + Raven gunshot detectors
Both Flock engines share an OUI table (`flock_oui.h`) split into two sets. The **core set** is the upstream colonelpanichacks field-tested Flock prefixes and is always on. An **extended set** — broad cellular/WiFi/control-chip vendor OUIs merged from other repos (Cradlepoint, Sierra Wireless, Liteon, Murata, Espressif) — is **off by default** because those prefixes appear on countless non-Flock devices (every ESP32 BLE radio, etc.) and cause false positives. Enable it under *Settings → Config → Hardware → Flock Detection → Extended OUI set* when you want maximum coverage and will triage the noise. The setting persists on the device and, in node mode, propagates from the manager to every node.

**Flock WiFi** runs 802.11 promiscuous, hopping channels **1 / 6 / 11** and firing a wildcard probe on each hop to pull responses faster than waiting for beacons (dwell and channel range are configurable in *Settings → Scan Timing*). It matches the OUI table against:
- **addr2 (transmitter)** — the device sending the frame.
- **addr1 (receiver)** — catches a Flock device that only appears as a frame's *target* (e.g. probe-response targets while it burst-sleeps); multicast/broadcast skipped.
- **addr3 (BSSID)** — on management frames.
- **Wildcard probe** — a broadcast probe-request with an empty SSID from a Flock OUI is treated as a strong camera signal ([DeFlockJoplin](https://github.com/DeflockJoplin/flock-you) field research).

Each hit reports which method fired (`addr1` / `addr2` / `addr3` / `wildcard_probe`) and decodes the AP's auth mode. Flock OUIs resolve in-app to both a surveillance label and the underlying chip vendor.

**Flock BLE** matches on OUI (core set by default, extended set when enabled — see above), advertised **name** (`FS Ext Battery`, `Penguin`, `Flock`, `Pigvision`, `FlockCam`, `FlockOS`, `FS-`, `FS_`, `flocksafety`), **manufacturer ID `0x09C8`** (XUNTONG, the camera battery vendor), and **Raven** gunshot-detector GATT service UUIDs. Name / manufacturer-ID / Raven-UUID matches are unaffected by the OUI toggle — only OUI matching narrows to the core set.

### Detector
Your watchlist. Add full MACs, OUI prefixes, name patterns, or 16-bit BLE service UUIDs. Matches on BLE adverts and on WiFi promiscuous frames (addr1/addr2/addr3).

### Foxhunter
Lock one target MAC and track its RSSI live across WiFi and BLE. Buzzer cadence speeds up as you get closer.

### Sky Spy
FAA Remote ID drones — BLE scan for **Open Drone ID** adverts plus WiFi promiscuous for **NAN / beacon** ODID frames. Decodes operator/UAV ID, position, altitude, ground speed, and heading.

### UniPwn
Unitree robots by BLE name prefix (`Go2_`, `G1_`, `H1_`, `B2_`, `X1_`). Detect → connect → exploitation actions: enable SSH, change root password, read serial/system info, reboot, arbitrary command exec.

### Wardrive
Logs every AP it hears — SSID, BSSID (addr3), channel, and decoded auth mode from beacons and probe-responses — stamped with GPS, WiGLE-style.

---

## Flash & Hardware

**Routine updates come from the app over OTA.** The web flasher is only for the first flash on a bare board, or recovery.

### Web Flasher
[lukeswitz.github.io/oui-spy-unified-blue](https://lukeswitz.github.io/oui-spy-unified-blue/) — Chrome / Edge 89+ (Web Serial). Plug in via USB-C, pick the target board (node / manager), Connect & Flash.

### Flash Layout
| File | Offset | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `bootloader.bin` | `0x0000` | Bootloader |
| `partitions.bin` | `0x8000` | Partition table |
| `boot_app0.bin` | `0xe000` | OTA data |
| `firmware.bin` | `0x10000` | App-controlled firmware |

### Hardware — Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-S3
USB-C · 8 MB flash · BLE 5 + WiFi · dual-core 240 MHz.

| Pin | Function |
|---|---|
| GPIO 3 | Piezo buzzer (PWM, app-controlled volume) |
| GPIO 4 | NeoPixel WS2812B (app-controlled brightness) |
| GPIO 21 | Onboard LED (active LOW) |
| GPIO 43/44 | Optional hardware GPS TX/RX (otherwise phone GPS is relayed) |

Managers run on **XIAO ESP32-S3** (recommended), **ESP32-S3 N16R8 DevKitC**, **XIAO ESP32-C3**, **ESP32 WROOM**, and **M5 Cardputer ADV**.

### Hardware — M5Stack Cardputer ADV
Stamp-S3A (ESP32-S3FN8) · 8 MB flash · **no PSRAM** · native USB · 1750 mAh battery. Runs the same headless node/manager firmware (the LCD/keyboard are not used). Board id: `cardputer_adv`.

| Pin | Function |
|---|---|
| GPIO 21 | Onboard WS2812 status LED (data) |
| GPIO 38 | LED/backlight **PWR_EN** — driven high at boot so the WS2812 lights |

> **Note:** GPIO 21 (WS2812 data) and GPIO 38 (PWR_EN) are confirmed against M5Unified and the [Plume](https://github.com/zmattmanz/plume) ADV firmware (`set_cardputer_led` → `neopixelWrite(21, …)`). The headless firmware must raise PWR_EN itself because — unlike a UI firmware — it never inits the LCD, whose driver would otherwise power that shared rail. **Download mode:** set the side power switch to OFF, hold **G0**, then apply power.
